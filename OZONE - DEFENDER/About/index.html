                <p>
                    <strong>Ozone Defender</strong> is a web-based platform designed to raise awareness about the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the ozone layer. Our goal is to empower individuals by providing them with insights into their environmental footprint, helping them make informed decisions to reduce harmful emissions and promote sustainability.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    We are committed to educating users on the critical role the ozone layer plays in protecting life on Earth. By offering an interactive tool that evaluates daily activities—such as vehicle usage, energy consumption, and industrial work—our platform helps users assess their contribution to ozone depletion and encourages them to adopt eco-friendly practices.
                </p>
                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ozone Defender</strong> allows users to input details about their transportation choices, fuel consumption, energy usage, and work-related activities. The platform then calculates the estimated environmental harm caused by these factors, providing actionable insights to help individuals reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to ozone layer preservation.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                <p>
                    We envision a world where people are fully aware of their environmental impact and actively take steps to reduce ozone depletion. Through awareness, education, and sustainable choices, we strive to create a cleaner, healthier planet for future generations.
